### minimal

Contains Fluence Node itself and some builtin services:

- [aqua-ipfs](https://github.com/fluencelabs/aqua-ipfs)
- [trust-graph](https://github.com/fluencelabs/trust-graph)
- [registry](https://github.com/fluencelabs/registry)

For those who want to run IPFS node separately. Serves as a base image for all
other image flavours.

### ipfs

Fluence Node packaged with
[IPFS node](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/command-line-quick-start/#take-your-node-online)
running inside container.

### rich

Fluence Node packaged with IPFS node,
[Ceramic](https://developers.ceramic.network/learn/welcome/) CLI and some other
binaries like bitcoin-cli or
[geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options).

## How to run

Copy `docker-compose.yml` locally and run

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

That will run 2 containers: local Fluence node and Network Dashboard connected
to it.

## How to open dashboard

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser
