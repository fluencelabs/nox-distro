# Running Rust Peer

Currently there is only one way to try out the Rust peer. It is by running it with [docker-compose](docker-compose/). An example configuration for popular orchestration platforms like [HasiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) and K8S are coming soon! Meanwhile, you can adapt [this docker-compose file](docker-compose/docker-compose.yml) for the platform of your choice.
