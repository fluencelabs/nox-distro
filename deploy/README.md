# Running rust-peer

Currently there is only one way to try out rust-peer:

- [Run with docker-compose](docker-compose/)

Example configuration for popular orchestation platforms like
[HasiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) and K8S are coming soon!
Meanwhile you can adapt [docker-compose file](docker-compose/docker-compose.yml)
for the platform of your choice.
